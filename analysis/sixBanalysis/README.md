## Installation

Please see the [README.md](https://github.com/UF-HH/sixB#install-instructions) in the root folder before attempting to run these skims if you haven't already. Once installation of the repo has been completed, follow these steps to set up the analysis code.

```
source scripts/setup.sh
make exe -j
```

## Run Skims

- Executable file is `bin/skim_ntuple.exe`
- Config files are located in `config/` directory
- Input files are located in `input/` directory (make sure to update these any time new samples are generated)

### To run a skim locally
The executable is run with command line options which can be printed out using 
```
./bin/skim_ntuple.exe --help
```

The main required options to run the script are
```
./bin/skim_ntuple.exe --input input/${file_list}.txt --cfg  config/${skim_config}.cfg --output ${output_file_name}.root
```

The shell script `run_skim.sh` can be modified to run on desired input file (remember to include `--is-signal` for signal files and `--is-data` for data files) with desired config file. Any command line argument passed to `run_skim.sh` are passed directly to `bin/skim_ntuple.exe`. You can change the max number of events to run on with `--maxEvts 1000`, for example. 
```
sh run_skim.sh --maxEvts 1000
```

### To submit skim jobs to Condor

Scripts to submit jobs to condor are in `scripts/` directory. Options are included to make it simple to submit jobs with no cuts `-n`, only apply preselections `-p`, jet energy scale `--jes` and jet energy resolution `--jer`, or to select events by btag `-b`.

```
sh scripts/submit_all_signal.sh
```
