! The following is the minimal settings that we used for the publication of our paper.
! It performs event generation with the `for_reweighting 1` settings (no virtual and modified subtraction), and then it reweights the events with the full, correct cross section.
! Thus the 'default' weight has the correct cross section for the parameters given in the powheg.input file. The "xwgtup" value in the Les Houches record does not correspond to
! a useful cross section.
! If more weights are needed, they should be included in the <initrwgt> section (see README.Compress-And-Weights for explanations).
! If weights are added to a previously existing .lhe file, i.e. `rwl_add 1`, the for_reweighting flag is ignored, and the full cross section
! is always used.

for_reweighting 1                                ! (default 0) Modifies subtraction to reduce reweighting factors (for adding the virtual contribution during the reweighing stage only)
