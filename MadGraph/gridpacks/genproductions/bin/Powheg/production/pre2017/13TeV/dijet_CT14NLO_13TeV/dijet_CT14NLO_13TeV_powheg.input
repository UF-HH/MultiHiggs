bornktmin 5d0       ! (default 0d0) Generation cut: minimum kt in underlying Born
bornsuppfact 300d0  ! (default 0d0) Mass parameter for Born suppression factor.
                     ! If < 0 suppfact = 1.

! To be set only if using LHA pdfs
lhans1  13100      ! pdf set for hadron 1 (LHA numbering)
lhans2  13100      ! pdf set for hadron 2 (LHA numbering)	

! To be set only if using different pdf sets for the two incoming hadrons

renscfact  1d0      ! (default 1d0) ren scale factor: muren  = muref * renscfact 
facscfact  1d0      ! (default 1d0) fac scale factor: mufact = muref * facscfact 

! Parameters to allow or not the use of stored data
use-old-grid    1    ! If 1 use old grid if file pwggrids.dat is present (<> 1 regenerate)
use-old-ubound  1    ! If 1 use norm of upper bounding function stored
                     ! in pwgubound.dat, if present; <> 1 regenerate

! A typical call uses 1/1400 seconds (1400 calls per second)
ncall1 20000         ! No. calls for the construction of the importance sampling grid
itmx1 5              ! No. iterations for grid: total 100000 calls ~ 70 seconds
ncall2 20000         ! No. calls for the computation of the upper bounding
                     ! envelope for the generation of radiation
itmx2 5              ! No. iterations for the above

! Notice: the total number of calls is ncall2*itmx2*foldcsi*foldy*foldphi
! these folding numbers yield a negative fraction of 0.5% with bornktmin=10 GeV.
! With these settings: ncall2*itmx2*foldcsi*foldy*foldphi=5M, 60 minutes
foldcsi 5            ! No. folds on csi integration
foldy   10            ! No. folds on  y  integration
foldphi 2            ! No. folds on phi integration

nubound 1000000       ! No. calls to set up the upper bounding norms for radiation.
                     ! This is performed using only the Born cross section (fast)

! OPTIONAL PARAMETERS


doublefsr 1          ! Default 0; if 1 use new mechanism to generate regions
                     ! such that the emitted harder than the
                     ! emitter in FSR is suppressed. If doublefsr=0 this is
                     ! only the case for emitted gluons (old behaviour). If
                     ! 1 it is also applied to emitted quarks.
                     ! If set, it strongly reduces spikes on showered output.
